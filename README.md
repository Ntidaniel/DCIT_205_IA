# Project Reflection
What this project has taught me:

Technical Skills: Extensive knowledge of front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Collaboration: Learned how to effectively communicate in a development team(even though this was a solo project i still got the concept of it all) by working on a collaborative project that used version control (Git).

Project Management: I acquired experience in adapting to unforeseen challenges, precise task planning and execution, resource managements, extensive research and managing my time effectively.
